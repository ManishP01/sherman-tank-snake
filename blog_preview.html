    <h1>🎮 Building Sherman Tank Snake: My AI-Assisted Retro Game Development Journey</h1>
    
    <p><em>How I created a unique WWII-themed hybrid game combining tank combat with snake mechanics using AI as my coding partner</em></p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>🚀 The Game That Started It All</h2>
    
    <p>When I set out to create a retro game, I didn't want to build just another clone. I wanted something that honored gaming history while bringing fresh mechanics to the table. That's how <strong>Sherman Tank Snake</strong> was born - a unique hybrid that combines the legendary M4 Sherman tank with classic snake gameplay and modern strategic elements.</p>

    <p><em>Sherman Tank Snake in action - notice the tactical trail system and fading effects</em></p>
    
    <h3>Why Sherman Tank Snake?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>The Vision</strong>: What if the classic Snake game had the weight and strategy of tank warfare? What if your "snake" was actually the trail left by a legendary WWII Sherman tank, and you could use that trail tactically to trap enemies?</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Appeal</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🚗 <strong>Historical Connection</strong>: The M4 Sherman was one of WWII's most iconic tanks</li>
        <li>🐍 <strong>Familiar Mechanics</strong>: Everyone knows Snake, but this adds strategic depth</li>
        <li>💥 <strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong>: Using your trail to create traps adds a puzzle element</li>
        <li>🎯 <strong>Unique Hybrid</strong>: I couldn't find anything quite like this combination</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 AI as My Development Partner: Effective Prompting Techniques</h2>
    
    <p>Working with AI to build this game taught me invaluable lessons about effective prompting. Here are the techniques that made the biggest difference:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Context-Rich Problem Framing</h3>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>❌ Ineffective Prompt:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>"Make a snake game with a tank"</code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>✅ Effective Prompt:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>"I want to create a hybrid game that combines classic Snake mechanics with WWII tank combat. The player controls a Sherman tank that leaves a trail behind it (like Snake), but the trail can be used strategically to trap enemies. The tank should have realistic rotation, the trail should fade over time, and trapped enemies should explode. Can you help me design the core game loop and tank movement system?"</code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Why it worked</strong>: Specific vision, clear mechanics, historical context, and defined success criteria.</p>
    
    <h2>📸 Screenshots and Gameplay Highlights</h2>
    
    <h3>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
    <img src="screenshots/demo_01_trail_system.png" alt="Tank Trail System">
    <p><em>The tank's trail system in action - notice how segments fade over time for strategic planning</em></p>
    
    <h3>Auto-Trap System</h3>

    <h2>🎯 Key Gameplay Features Captured:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Realistic Tank Movement</strong>: Smooth rotation and momentum-based physics</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Trail Usage</strong>: 5-second trail visibility for tactical planning</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Trap Detection</strong>: Automatic enemy encirclement detection</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Feedback</strong>: Clear indicators for trap activation and trail expiration</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive Damage</strong>: Battle damage affects tank performance</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>🚀 The Final Result</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Sherman Tank Snake</strong> became more than I initially envisioned:</p>
    
    <h3>Technical Achievements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Smooth, realistic tank physics</li>
        <li>✅ Intelligent auto-trap system</li>
        <li>✅ Progressive damage mechanics</li>
        <li>✅ Strategic trail-based gameplay</li>
        <li>✅ Smart enemy AI with self-preservation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Gameplay Innovation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>🎯 <strong>Unique Hybrid</strong>: Successfully combined tank combat with snake mechanics</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Strategic Depth</strong>: Trail management adds puzzle elements to action gameplay</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Immediate Feedback</strong>: Visual and audio cues make complex systems intuitive</li>
        <li>🏆 <strong>Replayability</strong>: Multiple strategies and emergent gameplay scenarios</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>💭 Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <p>Building Sherman Tank Snake with AI as my development partner was a revelation. It wasn't about AI replacing creativity - it was about AI amplifying it. I brought the vision, the creative decisions, and the gameplay intuition. AI brought the technical expertise, the algorithmic knowledge, and the implementation speed.</p>
    
    <p>The result? A unique game that honors both retro gaming history and modern innovation, built in a fraction of the time it would have taken solo, with higher code quality and more sophisticated systems than I could have created alone.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The future of game development isn't human vs AI - it's human + AI, and it's incredibly exciting.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>WASD or Arrow Keys: Move tank</li>
        <li>SPACEBAR: Shoot bullets</li>
        <li>T: Manually trigger traps</li>
        <li>ESC: Quit game</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Strategy Tips:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use your trail to encircle enemies for auto-traps</li>
        <li>Watch for blinking trail segments - they're about to disappear!</li>
        <li>Tank damage affects performance - avoid enemy fire</li>
        <li>Longer trails = bigger traps, but harder to manage</li>
    </ul>
